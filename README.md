# Localino-ROS

This repository contains ROS node that publishes Anchor and Tag distances. Tested with ROS kinetic ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Localino v2.0

Before launching the node, program each anchor and tag using arduino ide,
setting up of access point and other stuff is mentioned clearly in the guide
provided by Heuel & LÃ¶her GmbH & Co. KG.

To check if it is working point the tag towards an anchor, the anchor should
start blinking.
